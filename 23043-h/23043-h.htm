<p>This text of <i>Two Gentlemen of Verona</i> is from Volume I of the
nine-volume 1863 Cambridge edition of Shakespeare. The editors’ preface
(e-text <a href = "http://www.gutenberg.org/etext/23041">23041</a>) and
the other plays from this volume are each available as separate
e-texts.</p>

<p>General Notes are in their original location at the end of the play,
followed by the text-critical notes originally printed at the bottom of
each page. All notes are hyperlinked in both directions. In dialogue,
a&nbsp;link from a speaker’s name generally means that the note applies
to the entire line or group of lines.</p>

<p>Line numbers&mdash;shown in the right margin and used for all
notes&mdash;are from the original text. In prose passages the exact line
counts will depend on your browser settings, and will probably be
different from the displayed numbers. Stage directions were not included
in the line numbering.</p>

<p><a href = "#cast"><span class = "smallcaps">Dramatis
Personæ.</span></a> We have followed Steevens and the later editors in
reading ‘Proteus’ for ‘Protheus’; for though the latter form is
invariably used in the Folios, and was, in all probability, what
Shakespeare wrote, yet in choosing the name he doubtless meant to
compare the fickle mind of the lover with the changeable form of the
god. We have written ‘Panthino,’ not ‘Panthion,’ because the authority
of the first Folio preponderates in favour of the former, in itself the
more probable form of an Italian proper name. ‘Panthion’ occurs in
F<sub>1</sub>, among ‘the names of all the actors,’ and in a stage
direction at the beginning of Act II Sc. 2, but never in the text.
‘Panthino’ is found twice in the text, and once in a stage direction at
the beginning of Act I. Sc. 3. The blunder ‘Panthmo,’ I. 3. 76, which is
the reading of F<sub>1</sub>, shows that the original MS. had
‘Panthino,’ not ‘Panthion.’</p>

<i>What a fool is she.</i> The first Folio reads ‘What ’foole is she,’
doubtless to indicate an ellipsis of the indefinite article, which, for
the sake of the metre, was to be slurred over in pronunciation. As we
have not followed the Folio in reading <i>th’</i> or <i>th</i> for
<i>the</i> before a consonant, so we have thought it best to insert here
the omitted letter <i>a</i>, especially as the use of the apostrophe is
by modern custom much more restricted than it was in the Folio. For
example, we find <i>’Save for God save</i> (<i>Tempest</i>, II. 1. 162),
and <i>at ’nostrils for at’s nostrils</i> or <i>at the nostrils</i>
(<i>Id.</i> II. 2.&nbsp;60).</p>

This passage is corrupt. The usual explanation, which satisfies Delius,
is inadmissible, because Valentine would certainly not appear, like the
Knight of La Mancha, without his hose. A rhyming couplet was probably
what the author intended. Many conjectures might be made, as for
example:</p>

<div class = "poem">
<p>‘For he, being in love, could not see to garter his hose;</p>
<p>And you, being in love, cannot see to beyond your nose.’</p>
</div>

<p>Or, ‘to put spectacles on your nose.’ Or possibly, ‘to put on your
shoes,’ the point of which remark Valentine’s disordered dress might
make clear to the audience. Rosalind, when enumerating the marks of a
man in love, mentions the untied shoe as well as the ungartered hose,
<i>As You Like It</i>, Act III. Sc. 2. The same misprint, ‘hose’ for
‘shoes,’ occurs in the first edition of Greene’s <i>Groatsworth of
Wit</i>. See Mr Dyce’s preface to his edition of Greene’s <i>Dramatic
Works</i>, p.&nbsp;xxviii.</p>

As Speed after line 7 does not say a word during the whole of this long
scene, we have sent him off the stage. It is not likely that the clown
would be kept on as a mute bystander, especially when he had to appear
in the following scene.</p>

<p>The Folios give line 110 to Thurio, who, if the reading be right,
must have quitted the stage during the scene. The most probable time for
this would be on Proteus’ entrance, line 95. Mr Dyce however argues that
‘Thurio, after what the Duke, in the presence of Silvia, had said to him
about welcoming Proteus, would hardly run off the moment Proteus
appeared.’ But Thurio is not held up as a model of courtesy, and he
might as well be off the stage as on it, for any welcome he gives to
Proteus. Besides, in line 101 Valentine ignores Thurio altogether, who,
if he had been present, would not have remained silent under the
slight.</p>

<p>On the whole, we think that the arrangement we have given is the
best, as involving no change in the original reading. The question
however is a difficult and doubtful one&mdash;indeed, far more difficult
and doubtful than it is important, or instructive.</p>

Theobald’s correction, ‘mine eye,’ or as Mr Spedding suggests, ‘my eye’
(’my eie’ in the original spelling), is supported by a passage in the
<i>Comedy of Errors</i>, III. 2.&nbsp;55:</p>

<p class = "poem">
‘It is a fault that springeth from your eye.’</p>

<p>If this were not satisfactory, another guess might be hazarded:</p>

<p class = "poem">
‘Is it mine <i>unstaid mind</i> or Valentine’s praise.’</p>

<p>The resemblance of ‘mine’ and ‘mind’ in the printer’s eye (final d
and final e being perpetually mistaken for each other) might cause the
omission of the two words. ‘Valentine’ is found as a dissyllable
I.&nbsp;2.&nbsp;38. ‘Sir Valentine’s page, &amp;c.’: perhaps also III.
1. 191:</p>

<p class = "poem">
‘There’s not a hair on ’s head but ’tis a Valentine,’</p>

We have retained ‘Padua’ in the first of these passages and ‘Verona’ in
the second and third, because it is impossible that the words can be a
mere printer’s, or transcriber’s, error. These inaccuracies are
interesting as showing that Shakespeare had written the whole of the
play before he had finally determined where the scene was to be
laid.</p>

<p>The editors’ Preface (<a href =
"http://www.gutenberg.org/etext/23041">e-text 23041</a>) discusses the
17th- and 18th-century editions in detail; the newer (19th-century)
editions are simply listed by name. The following editions may appear in
the Notes. All inset text is quoted from the Preface.</p>

<p><b>Folios</b>:<br>
F<sub>1</sub> 1623; F<sub>2</sub> (no date given); F<sub>3</sub> 1663;
F<sub>4</sub> 1685.</p>

“The five plays contained in this volume occur in the first Folio in the
same order, and ... were there printed for the first time.”</p>

<p><b>Early editions</b>:<br>
Rowe 1709<br>
Pope 1715</p>
<p class = "inset">
“Pope was the first to indicate the <i>place</i> of each new scene; as,
for instance, <i>Tempest</i>, I.&nbsp;1. ‘On a ship at sea.’ He also
subdivided the scenes as given by the Folios and Rowe, making a fresh
scene whenever a new character entered&mdash;an arrangement followed by
Hanmer, Warburton, and Johnson. For convenience of reference to these
editions, we have always recorded the commencement of Pope’s
scenes.”</p>
